Code for the card game Fish.

We decided to code the card game Fish as our hackatown theme this year. The game can only be played with 6 players. We tried to implement the game using a TCP server but we ran into issues trying to figure out how to display different data on the screen for each player (since each player has different cards). In this repository, there will be the code needed for the game, the server, and the GUI.
